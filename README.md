#Sample Data CSV

#ABOUT

This is an example of extracting data from a csv file using PHP.


1. The total number of records in the file.

2. The total number of unique email addresses in the file.

3. The total number of valid email addresses in the file. (You can consider an email address valid if it conforms to the basic formatting standards of an email address)

4. A list of record counts by domain, sorted in descending order. (counts should be based on unique and valid addresses)
